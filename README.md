# A simple NextJS application that features GET and POST requests to a MongoDB database and hosted on Vercel

The primary purpose of this project was to understand the differences between Next and React. It was also a great opportunity to reinforce my knowledge about API calls, HTTP requests, MongoDB, deploying an application, and .env variables

Also special mention to Maximilian Schwarzm√ºller who has provided a really great React course (found on [Udemy](https://www.udemy.com/course/react-the-complete-guide-incl-redux/#instructor-2)) which has inspired and taught me a lot.
